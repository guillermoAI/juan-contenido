So you calendarly bookings instantly. So you calendarly bookings instantly. So you collect users and you have constantly collect users and you have constantly collect users and you have constantly like you kind of with this system, the like you kind of with this system, the like you kind of with this system, the three-step system, as I used the coffee three-step system, as I used the coffee three-step system, as I used the coffee shop example in the beginning. You shop example in the beginning. You shop example in the beginning. You eliminate inconsistency because what is eliminate inconsistency because what is eliminate inconsistency because what is happening right now? You're at 10K a happening right now? You're at 10K a happening right now? You're at 10K a month. Cool. One month you can still month. Cool. One month you can still month. Cool. One month you can still theif you can scale the 50K a month. theif you can scale the 50K a month. theif you can scale the 50K a month. Incredible. But what causes the drops in Incredible. But what causes the drops in Incredible. But what causes the drops in the info space? Why are so many info the info space? Why are so many info the info space? Why are so many info products dipping back to 30, scaling products dipping back to 30, scaling products dipping back to 30, scaling back up to 100 and then again dipping back up to 100 and then again dipping back up to 100 and then again dipping back to maybe even zero for a couple back to maybe even zero for a couple back to maybe even zero for a couple months? That is because there's no months? That is because there's no months? That is because there's no sustainability created in each sustainability created in each sustainability created in each component. We have offer and that is the component. We have offer and that is the component. We have offer and that is the marketing side of things, right? Then marketing side of things, right? Then marketing side of things, right? Then obviously we have acquisition, obviously we have acquisition, obviously we have acquisition, we have sales, so conversion and we have sales, so conversion and we have sales, so conversion and fulfillment. Let's say right now you're fulfillment. Let's say right now you're fulfillment. Let's say right now you're a one-man show. You are the person that a one-man show.

So the first thing we in the company. So the first thing we in the company. So the first thing we need to understand is that they're need to understand is that they're need to understand is that they're connected to each other. Whenever your connected to each other. Whenever your connected to each other. Whenever your setter books the most unqualified setter books the most unqualified setter books the most unqualified appointments, your closer will never appointments, your closer will never appointments, your closer will never close deals. And when your whole close deals. And when your whole close deals. And when your whole front-end team isn't even here, you front-end team isn't even here, you front-end team isn't even here, you would have nobody to fulfill for. would have nobody to fulfill for. would have nobody to fulfill for.

Meaning it's a chain. It's a connected. Meaning it's a chain. It's a cycle. Meaning if one of the components cycle. Meaning if one of the components cycle. Meaning if one of the components isn't optimized for 100%, it will isn't optimized for 100%, it will isn't optimized for 100%, it will instantly indicate a lack into the next instantly indicate a lack into the next instantly indicate a lack into the next component that is only optimized for component that is only optimized for component that is only optimized for 80%. The next one for 70%. And in the 80%. The next one for 70%. And in the 80%. The next one for 70%. And in the next one, the fulfillment sucks because next one, the fulfillment sucks because next one, the fulfillment sucks because it's only optimized for 30%. What it's only optimized for 30%.
